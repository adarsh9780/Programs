Modes:
1.) Insert Mode
2.) Command Mode
3.) Last-Line Mode

and many more.

The Basics of Moving in VIM:
1.) h,j,k,l moves the cursor left, up, down, and right respectively.
    You can use arrow keys in newer version to do the same.
    Former works in COMMAND MODE only while latter can be used in both.

2.) 0 moves cursor to the beginning of CURRENT line.
3.) $ moves cursor to the end of CURRENT line.
4.)(n)w moves cursor forward n word.
5.) (n)b moves cursor backward n word.
6.) G moves to the end of file.
7.) gg moves to the beginning of file.
8.) `. moves to the last edit.
* --> (n) n is integer, for example 7w will move cursor 7 words forward.

EDITING:
d stands for deleting.
dw will delete a word.
d0 will delete to the end of line 
and so on other commands will follow in conjugate with d command.

u will undo.

Search & Replace:
In command mode type: / followed by the text & hit enter after it.
If you want to find it again, hit n.
?followed by the text & hit enter after it.
If you hit n now, it will move backwards finding the word.
Hitting N moves the cursor to the next instance from the last search.

:%s/text/replacement text/g search and replace every instance of text with
	replacement text.

:%s/text/replacement text/gc search and replace every instance of text with
replacement text, but will ask for confirmation for doing that.

Copying & Pasting:
Deleted text is already placed in buffer.
Use p or P to paste.
This goes for single line, Multiple line and even for entire documents.

Select text:
In command mode, hit V to select rows using cursor.
CTRL-V is used to select columns.

After selecting hit y to yank, which basically moves to push in the stack.

Saving and Quitting:
:w will save the changes.
:w filename will change the filename

q will quit vim, if you have saved your changes, else will nag to save it before quitting.
